## Description

A mini game made with vanilla JavaScript without any libraries or framework. The player has 25 seconds to score over 30 points to win.

## Purpose of this App

As a gamer, I wanted to tap into the animation features of JavaScript in order to make something more fun and engaging


### Key Features
* Users can move the doggie by using the arrow keys to move left, right, jump, and sit
* Users can attack the enemies by holding down the 'enter' key to turn into a rolling fireball and gain score points. A special meteor attack can be made by holding down the 'enter' key, jump then hit the down key to decimate any nearby enemies with fire particles coming out.
* Users have 5 lives. If hit by a monster, -1 life and -3 points.

### Technology Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


### What challenges did I face, what did I learn?
* Not only did I learn about the key features of sprite animation, but the physics of the game such as using Math.random() to adjust the speed of the particles, and Math.sin() to create a wave of particles.
* Understanding the player dynamics such as sitting, running, hitting, and hitting was very foreign to me. Not only did I have to understand matching the images of the dog to these attacks but the angles, width, height,
and speed to make it a moveable creature took me a while to understand the concept and math behind it. With more practice comes with more familiarity!
